From January 2021 to November 2022: The increase in Revenue from January 2021 to November 2022 can be attributed to the significant growth in R&D, which saw an average value of $141.9 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of 3.50% over the period. This suggests that investment in research and development may have led to product or service innovations, contributing to revenue growth.

From January 2021 to November 2022: The increase in S&M_CAC from $161.8 thousand to $235.8 thousand, with an average value of $209.9 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of 1.73% over the period, suggests that the company's efforts in customer acquisition have been effective, directly impacting the revenue growth.

From November 2022 to January 2024: The decrease in Revenue from November 2022 to January 2024 coincides with a reduction in CurrentAssets_Total, which decreased from $6.4 million to $5.0 million with an average value of $5.2 million and a Compound Growth Rate of -1.72% over the period. This decline in current assets may indicate a reduction in operational liquidity, potentially affecting the company's ability to generate revenue.

From November 2022 to January 2024: The decrease in S&M_CAC from $235.8 thousand to $196.6 thousand, with an average value of $191.3 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of -1.29% over the period, may reflect a reduced investment in customer acquisition, which could directly lead to the observed revenue decline.

From January 2024 to April 2024: The increase in Revenue from January 2024 to April 2024 may be driven by the increase in S&M_CAC from $196.6 thousand to $249.4 thousand, with an average value of $216.4 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of 8.25% over the period. This suggests that intensified sales and marketing efforts, particularly in customer acquisition, have positively impacted revenue.

From January 2024 to April 2024: The reduction in Cogs from $133.2 thousand to $100.3 thousand, with an average value of $134.4 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of -9.03% over the period, may have contributed to the revenue increase by improving the company's cost efficiency, allowing for more competitive pricing or higher margins.

From January 2021 to November 2021: The significant increase in Revenue from $329.0 thousand to $802.1 thousand, with an average value of $541.0 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of 9.32% over 10 periods, is the primary driver for the increase in EBITDA Margin, as higher revenues directly contribute to a higher EBITDA Margin.

From January 2021 to November 2021: A decrease in G&A expenses from $235.8 thousand to $183.0 thousand, with an average value of $188.2 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of -2.50% over 10 periods, contributed to the increase in EBITDA Margin by reducing the operating expenses.

From November 2021 to January 2024: The decrease in Revenue from $802.1 thousand to $361.9 thousand, with an average value of $596.6 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of -3.01% over 26 periods, is the main cause for the decrease in EBITDA Margin, as lower revenues directly reduce the EBITDA Margin.

From November 2021 to January 2024: An increase in Opex_Total from $499.5 thousand to $603.6 thousand, with an average value of $594.6 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of 0.73% over 26 periods, further contributed to the decrease in EBITDA Margin by raising the total operating expenses.

From January 2024 to April 2024: The increase in Revenue from $361.9 thousand to $443.9 thousand, with an average value of $439.5 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of 7.05% over 3 periods, is the primary cause for the increase in EBITDA Margin, as higher revenues directly contribute to a higher EBITDA Margin.

From January 2024 to April 2024: A decrease in Cogs from $133.2 thousand to $100.3 thousand, with an average value of $134.4 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of -9.03% over 3 periods, also contributed to the increase in EBITDA Margin by reducing the direct costs associated with production.

From January 2021 to November 2021: The significant increase in Revenue from $329.0 thousand to $802.1 thousand, with an average value of $541.0 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of 9.32% over the period, compared to the preceding period, is the primary driver for the increase in Gross Margin. Higher revenue directly contributes to higher gross profit, which in turn increases Gross Margin.

From January 2021 to November 2021: The increase in Cogs from $90.5 thousand to $115.7 thousand, with an average value of $104.9 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of 2.48% over the period, indicates higher costs but at a slower rate than revenue growth, allowing Gross Margin to improve.

From January 2022 to November 2022: The increase in Revenue from $481.3 thousand to $865.6 thousand, with an average value of $642.2 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of 6.04% over the period, continues to be a direct cause for the increase in Gross Margin, as higher sales directly improve gross profit.

From January 2022 to November 2022: The decrease in Cogs from $125.5 thousand to $108.7 thousand, with an average value of $112.8 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of -1.43% over the period, directly contributes to the increase in Gross Margin by reducing the cost associated with goods sold.

From November 2022 to January 2024: The decrease in Revenue from $865.6 thousand to $361.9 thousand, with an average value of $574.6 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of -6.04% over the period, is the main cause for the decrease in Gross Margin, as falling revenue leads to a lower gross profit.

From November 2022 to January 2024: The increase in Cogs from $108.7 thousand to $133.2 thousand, with an average value of $102.1 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of 1.46% over the period, further pressures Gross Margin by increasing the costs of goods sold.

From January 2024 to April 2024: The increase in Revenue from $361.9 thousand to $443.9 thousand, with an average value of $439.5 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of 7.05% over the period, directly impacts Gross Margin positively by increasing the total revenue.

From January 2024 to April 2024: The decrease in Cogs from $133.2 thousand to $100.3 thousand, with an average value of $134.4 thousand and a Compound Growth Rate of -9.03% over the period, contributes to the Gross Margin increase by reducing the direct costs of goods sold.
